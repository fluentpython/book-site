This site complements the [Fluent Python, Second Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) book, with information like:

* Additional content that did not fit in the book.
* More _Soapbox_ postsâ€”my opinionated takes on Python, other languages, and random topics.
* Updates to content or code examples (none yet).
