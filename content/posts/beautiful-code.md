> The big revelation to me when I was in graduate school [was] when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.

**Lisp** and **Fortran** are the only two programming languages from the 1950's that are still relevant today. 

**Lisp** is simple and powerful. Over the decades, several **Lisp** dialects emerged.

* **Scheme** is a cleaned up **Lisp**, dropping some bad ideas and adding _closures_. There are [lots of implementations](http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-faq-standards#implementations) of **Scheme**.
* **Clojure** is a modern **Lisp** that compiles to **Java** bytecode and **JavaScript**. There's a [bank](https://building.nubank.com.br/working-with-clojure-at-nubank/) built with it.
* **lis.py** is Peter Norvig's interpreter for a subset of **Scheme** written in 130 lines of readable and maintainable **Python 3**.

This post is about **Scheme** and Norvig's beautiful code: **lis.py**.
