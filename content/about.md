**FluentPython.com** complements
**[Fluent Python, Second Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/)**
with [_extra content_](/extra/) that did not fit in the book.

Unless otherwise noted, the content of this site was written by me, Luciano Ramalho, the author of **Fluent Python**.

All the content and source code for the site is in the public repository
[fluentpython/book-site](https://github.com/fluentpython/book-site)
on Github.

## Work in Progress

This is a static site made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/).

I wrote **Fluent Python** in `asciidoc` format using the O'Reilly Atlas proprietary toolchain and stylesheets
to render PDF, Mobi (Kindle), ePub, and custom HTML for the
[O'Reilly Learning platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/).

Unfortunately, the rendering by AsciiDoctor+Hugo is different in many ways.
I still have a lot of work to do to make this site pretty. Sorry about that.
