## Work in Progress

This is a static site made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/).

I wrote **Fluent Python** in `asciidoc` format using the O'Reilly Atlas proprietary toolchain and stylesheets
to render PDF, Mobi (Kindle), ePub, and custom HTML for the
[O'Reilly Learning platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/).

Unfortunately, rendering with AsciiDoctor+Hugo is different in many ways.
I still have a [issues to fix](https://github.com/fluentpython/book-site/issues) to make this site pretty.

Help is welcome!
Please write a comment to an [existing issue](https://github.com/fluentpython/book-site/issues)
or open a new issue before sending pull requests.
Thank you!
