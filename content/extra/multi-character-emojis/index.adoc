Unicode has always supported building accented characters by combining letters and diacritics.
To accommodate the growing demand for emojis,
this idea has been extended to produce different pictographs by combining special markers and emoji characters.

== Country Flags

Throughout history, countries split, join, mutate or simply adopt new flags.
The Unicode consortium found a way to avoid keeping up with those changes
and outsource the problem to the systems that claim Unicode support:
its character database has no country flags.
Instead, there is a set of 26 "regional indicator symbols",
corresponding to latin letters from A to Z and assigned codes from U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF.
When you combine two of those indicator letters to form an ISO 3166-1 country code,
you get the corresponding country flag‚Äîif the UI supports it.
<<ex_two_flags>> shows how.

RIS_U = '\U0001F1FA'  # LETTER U

print(RIS_U + RIS_A)  # UA: Ukraine
print(RIS_A + RIS_A)  # AA: no such country

If your program outputs a combination of indicator letters that is not recognized by the app,
you get the indicators displayed as letters inside dashed squares‚Äîagain, depending on the UI.
See the last line in <<fig_two_flags>>.

[NOTE]
====
Europe and the United Nations are not countries, but their flags are supported by the regional indicator pairs EU and UN, respectively.
England, Scotland, and Wales may or may not be separate countries by the time you read this,
but they also have flags supported by Unicode.
However, instead of regional indicator letters, those flags require a more complicated scheme.
Read https://blog.emojipedia.org/emoji-flags-explained/[Emoji Flags Explained] on https://emojipedia.org/[Emojipedia] to learn how that works.

Now let's see how emoji modifiers can be used to set the skin tone of emojis that show human faces, hands, noses etc.

[[skin_sec]]
== Skin Tones

Unicode provides a set of 5 emoji modifiers to set skin tone from pale to dark brown.
They are based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale[Fitzpatrick scale]‚Äîdeveloped
to study the effects of ultraviolet light on human skin.
<<ex_skin>> shows the use of those modifiers to set the skin tone of the thumbs up emoji.

[[ex_skin]]
.skin.py: the thumbs up emoji by itself, followed by all available skin tone modifiers.

<5> Display emoji and tab.
<6> Display names of characters combined in the emoji, joined by `' + '`.

you write:
"THUMB = '\U0001F44d'  # THUMBS UP SIGN üëç"

While here in this text editor I see a thumbs up sign at the end of the line, in the PDF, both on Linux and Windows I only see an empty box - as you did not explain this line, I think this was not intentional.

Earlier in this chapter we used a figure (`unicodedata_name_fig`) because:

"emojis are not well supported by O'Reilly's digital publishing toolchain as I write this."

It looks like the same issue is happening here in Page 164, Ex 4-26 of `FluentPython2e-unreviewed-draft.pdf`.

The output of <<ex_skin>> looks like <<skin_demo_fig>> on MacOS.
As you can see, the unmodified emoji has a cartoonish yellow color,
while the others have more realistic skin tones.

Let's now move to more complex emoji combinations using special markers.

[[rainbow_sec]]
== Rainbow Flag and ZWJ Combinations

Besides the special purpose indicators and modifiers we've seen,
Unicode provides an invisible marker used as glue between emojis and other characters,
to produce new combinations: U+200D, ZERO WIDTH JOINER‚Äînicknamed "ZWJ" in many Unicode documents.

For example, the rainbow flag is built by joining the emojis WAVING WHITE FLAG and RAINBOW,
as <<fig_rainbow_flag>> shows.

[[fig_rainbow_flag]]
.Making the rainbow flag in the Python console.
image::images/rainbow-flag.png[alt="Making rainbow flag in console"]

Unicode 13 supports more than 1100 ZWJ emoji sequences as
RGI‚Äî"recommended for general interchange [...] intended to be widely supported across multiple platforms".footnote:[Definition quoted from http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/[Technical Standard #51 Unicode Emoji.]]
You can find the full list of RGI ZWJ emoji sequences in https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/13.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt[emoji-zwj-sequences.txt] and a small sample in <<fig_zwj_sample>>.

[[fig_zwj_sample]]
.Sample ZWJ sequences generated by <<ex_zwj_sample>>, running in a Jupyter Notebook, viewed on Firefox 72 on Ubuntu 19.10. This browser/OS combo can display all the emojis from this sample, including the newest: "people holding hands" and "transgender flag", added in Emoji 12.0 and 13.0.
image::images/zwj_sample.png[alt="Making rainbow flag in console"]

<<ex_zwj_sample>> is the source code that produced <<fig_zwj_sample>>. You can run it from your shell, but for better results I recommend pasting it inside a Jupyter Notebook to run it in a browser. Browsers often lead the way in Unicode support, and provide prettier emoji pictographs.

One trend in modern Unicode is the addition of gender-neutral emojis such as SWIMMER (U+1F3CA) or ADULT (U+1F9D1),
which can then be shown as they are, or with different gender in ZWJ sequences with the female sign ‚ôÄ (U+2640) or the male sign ‚ôÇ (U+2642).

[[family_sec]]
== Modern Families

The Unicode Consortium is also moving towards more diversity in the supported family emojis.
<<fig_emoji_families>> is a matrix of family emojis showing support for families with different combinations of parents and children‚Äîas of January 2020.

[[fig_emoji_families]]
.The table shows adult singles and couples at the top, and boys and girls on the left-hand side. Cells have the combined emoji of a family with the parent(s) from the top and kid(s) from the left. If a combination is not supported by the browser, more than one emoji will appear inside a cell. Firefox 72 on Windows 10 is able to show all combinations.
image::images/emoji_families.png[alt="Matrix of emoji families"]

The code I wrote to build <<fig_emoji_families>> uses the
https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/[Bottle framework]
to build and serve an HTML page with that matrix of family emojis.
You can find https://github.com/fluentpython/book-site/blob/main/content/extra/multi-character-emojis/emoji_families.py[_emoji_families.py_]
it in this site's public repository.

To see the page, install https://pypi.org/project/bottle/[Bottle],
run the _emoji_families.py_ script and visit http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/].

[TIP]
====
Browsers follow the evolution of Unicode Emoji closely, and here no OS has a clear advantage.
While preparing this chapter, I captured <<fig_zwj_sample>> on Ubuntu 19.10 and <<fig_emoji_families>> on Windows 10,
using Firefox 72 on both,
because those were the OS/browser combinations with the most complete support for the emojis in those examples.

*The Power of Football*

Why are England, Scotland, and Wales entitled to their own Unicode flags, but Catalonia, Pernambuco, and Texas are not?
Because the first three are permanent members of the International Football Association Board which controls the rules of football.
As such, they are allowed to enter their "national teams" in the FIFA World Cup‚Äîtherefore
media outlets need their flags to display tournament charts.
At least that's my theory.
