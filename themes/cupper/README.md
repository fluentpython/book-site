## Demo

https://cupper-hugo-theme.netlify.com/

## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo version `0.81.0` or higher is required. View the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and download the binary for your OS.

## Installation

From the root of your site:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme.git themes/cupper-hugo-theme
```

## Updating

From the root of your site:

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Run example site

From the root of `themes/cupper-hugo-theme/exampleSite`:

```
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```

## Configuration

Copy `config.yaml` from the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme/tree/master/exampleSite), then edit as desired. 

## Logo

Place your SVG logo at `static/images/logo.svg`. If you don't provide a logo, then the default theme logo will be used. 

## Favicons

Upload your image to [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) then copy-paste the generated favicon files under `static`. 

## Shortcodes

See the [full list of supported shortcodes](https://cupper-hugo-theme.netlify.com/cupper-shortcodes/).

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is provided by [Prism](https://prismjs.com/). See this [markdown code fences example](https://cupper-hugo-theme.netlify.com/cupper-shortcodes/#syntax-highlighting).


## Disable toc for a blog post

Blog posts that have two or more subheadings (`<h2>`s) automatically get a table of contents. To disable this set `toc` to `false`. For example:

```
---
title: "My page with a few headings"
toc: false
---
```

## Localization

The strings in the templates of this theme can be localized. Make a copy of `<THEME_BASE_FOLDER>/i18n/en.yaml` to `<YOUR_SITE_FOLDER>/i18n/<YOUR_SITE_LANGUAGE>.yaml`, and translate one by one, changing the `translation` field.

[Here is a tutorial that goes more in depth about this.](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/08/hugo-multilingual-part-2-i18n-string-localization/)

## Custom CSS and JS

You can provide an optional list of custom CSS files, which must be placed inside the `static` dir. These will load after the theme CSS loads. So, `static/css/custom_01.css` translates to `css/custom_01.css`.

You can provide an optional list of custom JS files, which must be placed inside the `static` dir. These will load after the theme JS loads. So, `static/js/custom_01.js` translates to `js/custom_01.js`.

See the [example site config file](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.yaml) for sample usage.

## Getting help

If you run into an issue that isn't answered by this documentation or the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme/tree/master/exampleSite), then visit the [Hugo forum](https://discourse.gohugo.io/).
